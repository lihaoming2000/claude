                    <h1>Beyond the Model: The Tools That Will Make Agentic AI Work</h1>
                    <p>AI agents are on the rise, but without the right tools, companies struggle to adopt them. Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming industries, and businesses are racing to deploy Agentic AI—AI-powered systems capable of autonomous decision-making and execution.</p>
                    <p>Startups are moving fast, building AI agents as core products. Enterprises, on the other hand, remain cautious, slowed down by concerns over security, compliance, governance, and reliability.</p>
                    <p>For Agentic AI to scale, companies need better tools—tools for reliability, security, and governance. This presentation examines how nimble startups "move fast" to integrate LLM capabilities, while established enterprises "take it slow" with caution and oversight.</p>

                <h2>Startups vs. Enterprises: LLM Adoption Status</h2>
                <p class="slide-description">Startups are rapidly adopting AI agents, focusing on speed and innovation rather than security and risk management. Big companies see the potential of Agentic AI, but concerns over security, compliance, and accuracy prevent rapid adoption.</p>

                        <h3>Startup Approach</h3>
                        <p>Moving fast to capitalize on generative AI with a "ship it now, fix it later" mentality. Over 40% of recent Y Combinator startups mention agents in their intro page.</p>

                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h3>Enterprise Approach</h3>
                        <p>Taking a cautious "let's think step by step" approach. Only 29% of enterprise leaders have a near-term vision for company-wide AI adoption, while 46% say it will take more than three years.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h3>Model Preferences</h3>
                        <p>Startups primarily use OpenAI models, while enterprises prefer Azure OpenAI due to security validations and data residency within their own Azure subscription.</p>

                        <h3>Model Selection</h3>
                        <p>Most still use GPT-4o/4o-mini, with few adopting O1 for reasoning due to cost concerns and limited need for advanced logic capabilities.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="slide-note">Startups are less bogged down by legacy systems or strict policies, allowing for rapid experimentation. They're building AI agents for semiconductor design, healthcare, real-time translation, GTM tools, robotics, and fintech solutions.</p>

                    <p>Accuracy becomes critical in multi-step processes. For example, in a 10-step business process like tracking a software bug, each step could be handled by a different AI Agent.

                    <p>Security is another key concern. New threats like prompt injection have introduced AI-specific security risks. Traditional security methods like Role-Based Access Control and logging are not enough in this AI-driven landscape.</p>

                    <p>Enterprises are not highly focused on these specialized tools yet, as most of their AI applications are still internal at the pilot stage. Many executives expressed interest in a platform to enable business users for AI application development.</p>

                    <p>70% of S&P 500 CIOs interviewed expressed needs for an AI platform for business users to build AI applications without IT bottlenecks. Just as cloud computing abstracted away server management and enabled the SaaS boom, AI platforms will abstract away model management and could enable an "AI-as-a-service" boom.</p>
