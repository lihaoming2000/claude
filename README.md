# Claude-GitHub-Azure Integration

A pilot project demonstrating end-to-end AI-powered web application development and deployment using Claude, GitHub, and Azure Web App Service through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## Overview

This repository showcases a seamless integration pipeline that enables:
1. Website creation through natural language prompts with Claude
2. Code repository management via GitHub using MCP
3. Automatic deployment to Azure Web App Service
4. Public access to the resulting web application

## Architecture

```
User → Claude → GitHub (via MCP) → Azure Web App Service → Public Internet
```

## Purpose

This integration demonstrates capabilities similar to commercial AI SaaS offerings by:
- Eliminating traditional development environment setup
- Enabling natural language-based application creation
- Automating the deployment pipeline
- Making applications instantly available to end-users

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Anthropic Claude access with MCP capabilities
- GitHub account with repository access
- Azure subscription with Web App Service

### Configuration
1. Set up MCP servers for filesystem and GitHub access
2. Configure GitHub Actions for Azure deployment
3. Link Azure Web App Service to this repository

## Implementation Details

This repository contains:
- Website source code generated by Claude
- Deployment configuration for Azure
- Documentation of the prompt-to-production workflow

## Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping of web applications
- Concept validation with minimal development overhead
- Educational demonstrations of AI-powered development
- Personal projects requiring quick deployment

## Future Enhancements

- Extend to additional cloud providers
- Implement CI/CD testing
- Add domain management integration
- Incorporate monitoring and analytics
